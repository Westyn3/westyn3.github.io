  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm Westyn Hilliard, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning enthusiast with a strong passion for AI and solving complex problems through technology. I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science, where I developed a strong foundation in machine learning, data visualization, and predictive modeling. I've applied these skills to real-world challenges, including work at UPS where I developed tools to optimize freight flow and automate routing decisions using OCR and AI-based models, as well as using Speech-to-Text, Gemini, and Text-To-Speech to streamline trailer and bay assignments.</p>
  <p>What excites me most about data science is its ability to transform raw information into meaningful, actionable outcomes. I bring a balanced approach to my work—blending creativity with structure—to solve complex problems and deliver solutions that create real impact.</p>
  <p>Outside of work, I’m committed to lifelong learning and applying knowledge in practical ways. Whether I’m refining my programming skills, exploring new analytics tools, or enjoying the outdoors of East Tennessee, I’m always looking for ways to grow. You’ll often find me playing pickleball, out on a run, or spending time with family.</p>
